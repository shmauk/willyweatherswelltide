# willyweatherswelltide
An integration for home assistant that reads swell and tide data for willy weather based on the code from @safepay: https://github.com/safepay/sensor.willyweather

Currently creates 12 entities, 3 for each of the next 4 tide events: dateTime, type (high/low), height

Coming in the next few days:
- Swell forecast for the next 24 hours
- Multiple location support

Coming later:
- Card to display all the information nicely
